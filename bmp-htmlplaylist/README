bmp-htmlplaylist

bmp-htmlplaylist is a simple application which saves your
current beep-media-player playlist to html file. I've
thought about xml output, including css styles etc, but
really I'm not sure about it now. If you have some ideas, 
simply mail me: bogorodskiy@inbox.ru

Usage:

$ bmp-htmlplaylist > playlist.html
